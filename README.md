# InterSoccer Product Variations Plugin

## Overview
The `intersoccer-product-variations` plugin extends WooCommerce (WooComm) functionality for InterSoccer Switzerland's event booking system. It manages product variations for soccer camps, courses, and birthdays, enabling dynamic assignment of attributes like "Days-of-week" for camps and prorated discounts for courses based on remaining weeks. The plugin ensures a seamless user experience for parents assigning children (players) to events during the purchase process.

This plugin is part of the InterSoccer Website Redesign project, built on WordPress (WP) and WooComm, aligning with InterSoccer's business model of offering soccer camps (full week or single days), courses (season-long, prorated), and birthday events.

## Features
- **Dynamic Product Variations**:
  - Camps: Supports "Full Week" or "Single Day(s)" variations with a multi-select (select2) interface for choosing days (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) based on the `pa_days-of-week` attribute.
  - Courses: Applies prorated pricing based on `Start-Date` and `End-Date` attributes, discounting based on remaining weeks (e.g., 16-week course with 10 weeks left reduces price by 6 weeks).
  - Birthdays: Manages variations like additional t-shirts or medals.
- **Player Assignment**: Integrates with the player-management-plugin to assign children to events during checkout.
- **Attribute Handling**: Adds all product attributes (e.g., "Assignee", "Days-of-week", "Discount") to the cart and order details, visible to customers.
- **Buy Now/Add to Cart**: Enables buttons only after a player is assigned to the event.

## Usage

2. **Parent Workflow**:

   - The plugin dynamically displays a select2 multi-select for single-day camp variations and calculates prorated course prices.
   - Attributes are added to the cart and visible in order confirmation emails.
3. **Admin Workflow**:
   - Shop managers can view assigned players and event details in WooCommerce orders.

## Development
- **Dependencies**: Requires WordPress, WooCommerce, and the `player-management-plugin` for player assignment.
